# Hierarchical Retrieval System 🚀

📚🤖 I'm excited to share my latest project—a **RAG-based question-answering system** designed using **Streamlit** and the **GROQ API**! This system leverages **hierarchical tree-based indexing** to navigate through multiple topics within a selected book, delivering precise and contextually relevant responses to user queries.I have here used the "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition
by Aurélien Géron" book to create the hierarchical tree of topics.

## 🔍 What Does It Do?
- **Organizes** content into a hierarchical structure, making it easy to traverse chapters, sections, and topics.
- **Combines** the power of traditional retrieval methods like **Rank-BM25** with modern transformer-based models for enhanced accuracy.
- **Interacts** seamlessly through a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **PYPdf2**: For PDF parsing.
- **GROQ API**: Core to the retrieval process.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive UI.
- **Rank-BM25**: To ensure relevant content retrieval.
- **Transformers & PyTorch**: For powerful natural language processing.
- **NLTK & Gensim**: For text processing and topic modeling.
- **Numpy**: For efficient numerical operations.
